# Swift for TensorFlow Deep Learning Library

Get a taste of *protocol-oriented differentiable programming*.

This repository hosts [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift)'s deep learning library, available both as a part of Swift for TensorFlow toolchains and as a Swift package. 

## Usage

This library is being [automatically integrated](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/tensorflow#customize-tensorflow-support) in Swift for TensorFlow toolchains. You do not need to add this library as a Swift Package Manager dependency.

### Use Google Colaboratory

[**Open an empty Colaboratory now**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/notebooks/blank_swift.ipynb) to try out Swift, TensorFlow, differentiable programming, and deep learning.

> For detailed usage and troubleshooting, see [Usage](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Usage.md) on the Swift for TensorFlow project homepage.

#### Define a model

Simply import `TensorFlow` to get the full power of TensorFlow.

```swift
import TensorFlow

let hiddenSize: Int = 10

struct Model: Layer {
    var layer1 = Dense(inputSize: 4, outputSize: hiddenSize, activation: relu)
    var layer2 = Dense(inputSize: hiddenSize, outputSize: hiddenSize, activation: relu)
    var layer3 = Dense(inputSize: hiddenSize, outputSize: 3, activation: {$0})
    
    @differentiable(wrt: (self, input))
    func applied(to input: Tensor<Float>) -> Tensor<Float> {
        let l1 = layer1.applied(to: input)
        let l2 = layer2.applied(to: l1)
        return layer3.applied(to: l2)
    }
}
```

#### Run a training loop

```swift
let optimizer = SGD<Model, Float>(learningRate: 0.02)
var classifier = Model()
let x: Tensor<Float> = ...
let y: Tensor<Float> = ...

for _ in 0..<1000 {
    let ùõÅmodel = classifier.gradient { classifier -> Tensor<Float> in
        let ≈∑ = classifier.applied(to: x)
        let loss = softmaxCrossEntropy(logits: ≈∑, labels: y)
        print("Loss: \(loss)")
        return loss
    }
    optimizer.update(&classifier, along: ùõÅmodel)
}
```

## Development

### Requirements

* [Swift for TensorFlow toolchain](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md).
* An environment that can run the Swift for TensorFlow toolchains: Linux 18.04 or macOS with Xcode 10.

### Building and testing

```
$ swift build
```
```
$ swift test
```

# Swift for TensorFlow APIs

This repository hosts [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift)'s deep learning library, available both as a part of the Swift for TensorFlow toolchain and as a Swift package.

## Requirements

* A latest [Swift for TensorFlow toolchain](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md).

## Usage

A [Swift for TensorFlow toolchain](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md)
is required to use this package. Add the following to your Swift package manifest.

```swift
packages: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis.git")
]
```

To get started, simply import `TensorFlow` in your Swift code.

```swift
import TensorFlow

struct Model: Layer {
    var l1, l2: Dense<Float>

    init(hiddenSize: Int) {
        l1 = Dense<Float>(inputSize: 2, outputSize: hiddenSize, activation: relu)
        l2 = Dense<Float>(inputSize: hiddenSize, outputSize: 1, activation: relu)
    }

    @differentiable(wrt: (self, input))
    func applied(to input: Tensor<Float>) -> Tensor<Float> {
        let h1 = l1.applied(to: input)
        return l2.applied(to: h1)
    }
}

let optimizer = SGD<Classifier, Float>(learningRate: 0.02)
var classifier = Model(hiddenSize: 4)
let x: Tensor<Float> = ...
let y: Tensor<Float> = ...

for _ in 0..<1000 {
    let ùõÅmodel = classifier.gradient { classifier -> Tensor<Float> in
        let ≈∑ = classifier.applied(to: x)
        let loss = meanSquaredError(predicted: ≈∑, expected: y)
        print("Loss: \(loss)")
        return loss
    }
    optimizer.update(&classifier.allDifferentiableVariables, along: ùõÅmodel)
}
```

## Building
